# Lucky 38 Smart Contract

Welcome to the most exciting casino smart contract of the Lucky 38 Casino.
This smart contract consists of a runnable version of Blackjack which will be deployed on the Rinkeby Testnet.

## Rules of the game:

A player joins a game and invests a sum of ether, which is his playing capital.
He then chooses a bet between 0.01 and 3 ether for the new hand. The player then gets dealt his first card of the hand. 5% of this bet get set aside as a playing commission for the casino.
Furthermore, the player can either hit another card until the amount of the value of his cards gets larger than 21 or he decides to stand.
When the player goes over the value of 21, he automatically looses his current bet an can either play another round or withdraw his resuming funds.
If a player decides to stand before reaching 21 or when he reaches 21, the dealer takes up cards until the value of his cards are either over 21 or over 17.
If the dealer goes over 21, the player wins double his bet. If they reach a draw, the player receives his bet back.
The player can play as long as he has sufficient funds or as long as he wants.
